## Critique

Like every project, our Posterr still needs improvement to run well at large scale.
for exemple:

- [ ] create authentication layer
- [ ] implement pagination in post list
- [ ] implement socket to receive real-time events of post creation from other users
- [ ] improve service layer, better separating responsibilities from services
- [ ] implement design system to ensure standard and documentation of components on the platform, we could use StoryBook for example
- [ ] implement code push to improve ci/cd flow and quick fixes in the app once published in stores
- [ ] implement ci/cd using appcenter or bitrise for example
- [ ] create more test from screen and components
